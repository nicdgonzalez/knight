# Knight

**Knight** allows you to switch system themes automatically based on the time
of day for the GNOME desktop environment on Linux.

## ‚ú® Features

- Automatically toggle between light and dark theme.
- Determines sunrise and sunset times based on your location.
- Configurable through a dedicated configuration file.
- Supports temporarily pausing automatic switching.

## üì¶ Installation

Install this project using Rust's package manager, cargo:

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/nicdgonzalez/knight
```

### Scheduling

In order to have the program run itself throughout the day, you need to use
some sort of scheduler (e.g., systemd, cron, etc.). Here are some examples for
popular scheduling services:

Copy and paste the following into a file named `knight.sh`:

<details>

<summary>Systemd</summmary>

```bash
#!/usr/bin/bash

set -eo pipefail
[ ! -z "${TRACE+x}" ] && set -x

SYSTEMD_CONFIG_HOME="${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/systemd/user"

SERVICE_FILE="\
[Unit]
Description=Changes the system between light and dark theme automatically

[Service]
ExecStart=$HOME/.cargo/bin/knight
Type=exec
";

TIMER_FILE="\
[Unit]
Description=A timer for Knight

[Timer]
# Runs once every five minutes.
OnCalendar=*-*-* *:*/5:00
# Run the task if it was missed (e.g., because the system was asleep).
Persistent=true
WakeSystem=false

[Install]
WantedBy=timers.target
";

main() {
    # Write the configurations into their respective files.
    mkdir --parents "$SYSTEMD_CONFIG_HOME" \
        && echo "$SERVICE_FILE" > "$SYSTEMD_CONFIG_HOME/knight.service" \
        && echo "$TIMER_FILE" > "$SYSTEMD_CONFIG_HOME/knight.timer"

    # Make systemd aware of our changes.
    systemctl --user daemon-reload

    # Start the service and timer.
    systemctl --user start knight.service
    systemctl --user start knight.timer

    # Allow the service and timer to persist after reboots.
    systemctl --user enable knight.service
    systemctl --user enable knight.timer

    # Check that the units are running properly:
    systemctl --user status knight.service
    systemctl --user status knight.timer
}

# The main entry point to the script.
main "$@"
```

</details>

<details>

<summary>Cron</summary>

```bash
#!/usr/bin/bash

set -eo pipefail
[ ! -z "${TRACE+x}" ] && set -x

SYSTEMD_CONFIG_HOME="${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/systemd/user"

main() {
    # This job will execute the program every 5 minutes.
    local job="*/5 * * * * $HOME/.cargo/bin/knight"

    # If the job already exists, return.
    if grep --fixed-strings "$job" -- <(crontab -l) > /dev/null; then
        echo >&2 "Job already exists!"
        return 0
    fi

    # Add the new job to the end of the existing cron file.
    crontab <(echo -e "$(crontab -l)\n$job")
}

# The main entry point to the script.
main "$@"
```

</details>

Now run the script using bash:

```bash
bash "$PWD/knight.sh"
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

Knight is configurable to better fit your needs. An optional configuration file
can be created at `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/knight/Knight.toml`. For more details, see
[Knight.toml](./Knight.toml).

### Example

```toml
[fallback]
sunrise = "06:30:00"
sunset = "18:30:00"

[location]
enabled = true

# Uncomment and set the following values if setting manually:
# longitude = 0.0
# latitude = 0.0
```
